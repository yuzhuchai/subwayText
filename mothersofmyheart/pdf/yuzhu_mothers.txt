Who were they? All these mothers who seem mothers to me still? Gu Cheng, who’s poem I have suckled on, thus, the seed of romantics sprouted itself in me long before I understood the word romantics. The man who cut up his trousers and wore it as a hat. Gu Cheng, the living strings of Vladimir Mayakovsky’s ‘If you prefer, / I’ll be pure raging meat, / or if you prefer, / as the sky changes tone, / I’ll be absolutely tender, / not a man, but a cloud in trouser!’ His wife, killed by an ax to the head. His killing, his fragile heart of a poet that cannot withstand the brutal collision of the ideal and the real. I have worshiped his fragileness, his violence, and his rage; His madness. He gave me the heart of a poet, but not the courage; abandon his children for his own splendid ‘waywardness’. I loved him still, in my own wayward ways.
