text("Who were they? All these mothers who seem mothers to me still?\n\nDana, who impregnated me with this brain child; a complete stranger just a week ago. Your mothers who have been my mothers, and your mothers who will soon become my mothers. \n\nSo sometimes I put my text on top of your text, sometimes my text is distant from yours, and sometimes they are a coherent body. But, however they are intertwined, this is a poem dedicated to all the mothers whomever your children are. \n\nGu Cheng, who’s poem I have suckled on, thus, the seed of romantics sprouted itself in me long before I understood the word romantics. The man who cut up his trousers and wore it as a hat. Gu Cheng, the living strings of Vladimir Mayakovsky’s ‘If you prefer, / I’ll be pure raging meat, / or if you prefer, / as the sky changes tone, / I’ll be absolutely tender, / not a man, but a cloud in trouser!’ \n\nHis wife, killed by an ax to the head. His killing, his fragile heart of a poet that cannot withstand the brutal collision of the ideal and the real. I have worshiped his fragileness, his violence, and his rage; His madness. He gave me the heart of a poet, but not the courage; abandon his children for his own splendid ‘waywardness’. I loved him still, in my own wayward ways.\n\nThe girl that used to live 20 floors above me when we were in school together, whose name I now give to the barista every morning at the coffee. Alas, they always wrote it down wrong (Rupi). Ruby, the punk rock girl that I would create in my movies. To this day, I never created any movies about punk rock girls. \n\nBut, if I do. \n\nIt would be about our skinned knees in the mosh pit made of sweaty dudes, and the nihilistic girlfriends, and the chaotic world of your paintings, and our instant poems and long talks nights after nights, and of course, your cat who couldn't even jump on a table.\n\n",10, 10, width/1.04,5000)
